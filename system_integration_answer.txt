At Think Neural AI, I resolved a data integration challenge between a legacy retail ERP system and our AI-powered analytics platform. The systems used incompatible data formats, causing significant reporting delays. I designed and implemented a Python-based middleware layer using API connectors to normalize incoming sensor data streams and automate the ingestion process. This solution reduced data latency by 40 percent and ensured seamless data flow for real-time inventory management.
